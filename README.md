# Changinging text in files using Node
I found that I was creating the same setup repeatedly so I just turned it into a repository. This is very much a personal tool and probably less useful to anyone else. Based in async await and wrapping non-async functions in promises.

Uses:
- [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra) just for some helpful async utilities.
- [atomically](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/atomically#readme) makes input and output of files a bit simplier.
- [strman](https://github.com/dleitee/strman) a number of methods for manipulating strings.
- [fast-glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-glob) glob to help grab files.
